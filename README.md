# Welcome to the BM-Segmenter project

The BM-Segmenter projects aims to simplify image segmentation in the Bio-Medical setting. This program should provide all the tools for a researcher that has no programming and machine-learning experience to easily create automatic segmentations models.

## Features

* Create and import projects
* Create and import datasets (from CT dicoms and normal png / jpeg images)
* Tools for image segmentation
* Tools for training machine learning models on datasets
* Tools for measurements on datasets and export to csv

## State of the project

This project is currently developped at the [Lausanne University Hospital](https://www.lausanneuniversityhospital.com/home) (known as CHUV). Currently, this tools is in a experimental phase. To see the state of the implemented features, please visit [this page](https://github.com/jokteur/BM-Segmenter/wiki/Outline-of-the-project).
